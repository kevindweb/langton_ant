what do we need
    - object to move around different grid points - call it player
        - player position will be global so window can access where player is
            - will be a tuple (x position, y position) in 2d array
        - player starts facing a random direction (n, s, e, w)
            - direction is also global so we know how to maneuver
    - window that can create a grid of certain size
        - stop running program if the window closes, or the player is outside of grid
    - need grid objects to hold data about whether we have visited this box
        - visited (boolean) = false initially
        if visited:
            move left
        else:
            move right
            visited = true
    - have a move function that takes 0 or 1, left or right - move (int)
        switch direction:
            case 'n':
                if move: // move == right
                    east() // make player face east
                else:
                    west()
                break
            case 's':
                if move:
                    west()
                else:
                    east()
                break
            case 'e':
                if move:
                    south()
                else:
                    north()
                break
            case 'w':
                if move:
                    north()
                else:
                    south()
                break

    - create move functions
        // remember we are using indices, not a graph, -1 in row in 2d array means +1 in y axis
        def north():
            player.direction = 'n'
            player.position[1] -= 1
        def south():
            player.direction = 's'
            player.position[1] += 1
        def east():
            player.direction = 'e'
            player.position[0] += 1
        def west():
            player.direction = 'w'
            player.position[0] -= 1
